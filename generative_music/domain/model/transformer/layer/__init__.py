"""Transformer Layers Package.

This package contains the implementation of various layers and components
used in Transformer model architecture, such as Multi-head Attention,
Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks, and Positional Encoding.
These layers can be combined to create custom Transformer models
for generative music tasks.
