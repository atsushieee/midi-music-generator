"""MIDI Data Processing Package.

This package contains the implementation of various MIDI data processing functionalities,
which are essential for preparing and augmenting MIDI files for machine learning tasks.
The package includes functionalities for splitting MIDI files into train, validation and test sets,
segmenting MIDI files into smaller pieces, encoding MIDI data into numerical representations
and augmenting MIDI data through techniques such as stretching and key changes.
These functionalities improve the quality and variety of the training data,
leading to better model performance and generalization capabilities.
